# Flight-Price-Prediction
We will use machine learning, which can help airlines predict what prices they can maintain and also help customers predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.

In this project, we will be using essential exploratory data analysis techniques for analyzing the dataset which helps us draw some insights about the price of the flight based on the features and develop a predictive Machine learning model to predict the future pricing of the flights.
